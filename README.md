# 🚀 Design Patterns

Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They help make code more maintainable, reusable, and scalable. In this repository, the patterns are grouped under three main categories:

---

## Creational Patterns
Patterns focused on object creation.

- [Factory Method](/creational/factory-method/)
- [Abstract Factory Method](/creational/abstract-factory-method/)
- [Builder](/creational/builder/)
- [Prototype](/creational/prototype/)
- [Singleton](/creational/singleton/)

## Structural Patterns
Patterns that help organize classes and objects.

- [Adapter](/structural/adapter/)
- [Bridge](/structural/bridge/)
- [Composite](/structural/composite/)
- [Decorator](/structural/decorator/)
- [Facade](/structural/facade/)
- [Flyweight](/structural/flyweight/)
- [Proxy](/structural/proxy/)

## Behavioral Patterns
Patterns for communication between objects.

- [Chain of Responsibility](/behavioral/chain-of-responsibility/)
- [Command](/behavioral/command/)
- [Iterator](/behavioral/iterator/)
- [Mediator](/behavioral/mediator/)
- [Memento](/behavioral/memento/)
- [Observer](/behavioral/observer/)
- [State](/behavioral/state/)
- [Strategy](/behavioral/strategy/)
- [Template Method](/behavioral/template-method/)
- [Visitor](/behavioral/visitor/)
